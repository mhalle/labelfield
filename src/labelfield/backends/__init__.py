"""Backend registry. Every backend exposes ``available()`` and
``run(logits, out, tables, lut, *, mode, paint, background, threshold, **opts)``
writing labels into ``out`` in place. A fused one also exposes
``cannot_take(logits_shape, out_shape)``: why its kernel cannot address a field, or None.

``lut`` is the kernel's table (:func:`labelfield.labels.kernel_lut`): in an argmax paint a
channel whose entry is -1 is transparent, and every other entry is the label written."""
